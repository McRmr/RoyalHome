<h1>Recipe to make of churchkhela</h1>
<p><img src="image\img1.jpg" alt="Different of kind a churchkhela" width="1024" /></p>
<div class="main";><p>Churchkhela is a traditional Georgian cuisine candle-shaped candy. The main ingredients are grape must, nuts, and flour. Almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, and chocolate and sometimes raisins are threaded onto a string, dipped in thickened grape juice or fruit juices and dried in the shape of a sausage. The traditional technology of churchkhela in the Kakheti region was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2015.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<div>
<ol>
<li style="color:red;">300 grams of nuts (you can use both hazelnuts or walnuts)</li>
<li>1.5 liters of badagi (sweet grape juice)</li>
<li>Few tbsp of sugar to your taste</li>
<li class="active";>150-200 grams of flour</li>
<li id="qwer">A needle and thread</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Preparation:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="capital_letter";>S</span>hell the walnuts (hazelnuts).Toast the nuts on a low-medium heat for 2-3 minutes until the nuts have a crisp crunch, but don’t burn them. Remove from the heat, let them slightly cool down and break the walnuts on halves, leave hazelnuts as they are. Try to remove the skins from walnuts with your fingers. String nuts on a thread using strong thread and needle. The length of churchkela depends on you, yet, as a rule, you have to thread 25 walnut halves.
</li>
<li>
<span class="capital_letter";>M</span>ix half of badagi juice with sugar and flour using mixer, until you get smooth mixture. Preheat the rest part of juice in the saucepan and gradually add the mixture. Stir the mixture thoroughly and bring to the boil. When the mix thickens make sure that it does not taste flour. You can add 3-4 tbsp of sugar if it is not sweet enough. When you get cream-like consistency, remove it from the stove. The resulting mixture is called tatara.
</li>
<li>
<span class="capital_letter";>I</span>nsert nuts into tatara and use wooden spoon to cover the threaded nuts. Depending on the thickness of tatara, you may have to pour the nuts again until it stops dripping. When all the nuts are well covered, hang the churchkhela somewhere to dry. You can use a pole placed between two chairs. Leave the churchkhela to dry for 3 to 4 days. You can eat churchkhela once they are dry but it is recommended to wrap them in towels and enjoy these sweet candies for Christmas after 2 to 3 months.
